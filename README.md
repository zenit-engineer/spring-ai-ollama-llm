Spring Boot Ollama Integration â€“ This project demonstrates how to use local Ollama AI models through a web API with Spring Boot. 
It includes endpoints for text generation and model listing, using Spring WebClient to interact with the Ollama API.

**
Attention first set up ollama on local machine or via docker container.
Than take LLM locally I prefer deepseek or llama.
